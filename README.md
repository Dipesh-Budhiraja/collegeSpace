I have made a music player using html, css, javascript, nodejs(express), jquery, dropzone, mongodb, mysql.
This will run only run on local machine because the sql database is based on local machine so. But mongoDB is used for
creating playlist and storing information about songs

I have uploaded video for the project for viewer's reference and here is the link of the video:
